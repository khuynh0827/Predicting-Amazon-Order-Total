# Predicting Amazon Order Totals Using Regression Models 

This project uses data from a survey conducted on approximately 5000 Amazon customers from January 2018 to December 2022 to create several predictive models for customer order totals. For exploratory data analysis, techniques used involve power transformations, histograms, box plots, scatterplots, bar charts, and multi-covariate plots. Models used involve random forests, k nearest neighbors, linear regression, support vector machines, boosted tree models, decision trees, and ensemble models that combine the previously mentioned models.

[This project was completed for a Kaggle regression competition for UCLAâ€™s STATS 101C Course - Introduction to Statistical Modeling and Data Mining.]
